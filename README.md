# Jonker Volgenant algorithm
## Generalized Jonker-Volgenant shortest path assignment algorithm


C language functions implementing a
generalized Jonker-Volgenant shortest path assignment algorithm
to solve the two-dimensional assignment problem with a
rectangular cost matrix C. The function assign2DC (commented
below) can perform cost maximization or minimization with cost
matrices having positive and/or negative elements whereas the
function assign2DCBasic assumes that all elements of C are
positive and that only minimization is performed. See the
comments to the Matlab implementation of assign2D for more
details on the algorithm.
