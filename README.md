# C implementation of the Jonker Volgenant algorithm
## Assignment problem in a bipartite graph


A C implementation of the Jonker-Volgenant algorithm to solve the minimum (or maximum) assignment problem in a bipartite graph. The function assign2DC can perform cost maximization or minimization with cost
matrices having positive and/or negative elements whereas the
function assign2DCBasic assumes that all elements of C are
positive and that only minimization is performed.
